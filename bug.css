The following CSS code snippet exhibits a common yet easily overlooked error:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

The intention is to distribute three `.item` elements evenly within the `.container`.  However, if three or more `item` elements are added to the container, they will overlap because `space-between` only works effectively with two elements.
